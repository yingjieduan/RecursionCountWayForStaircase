How many ways to reach the top of the staircase

There is a classic algorithm question like “How many ways to reach the top of the staircase, given the total number of steps in staircase and climb how many number you can take in each time”. For example, here are totally 100 steps in staircase, you can climb 1,2,3,7,11 steps each time. How many ways to reach the top of the staircase?

This question is a bit difficult than the one you usually see, because the number of steps could be arbitrary. I provide a solution here which is quite efficent and doesn't recount any steps you already walked. It can also accept any list of steps you asked to climb each time.
